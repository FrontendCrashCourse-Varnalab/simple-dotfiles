Simple Dotfiles
===============

Easy, no nonsense, basic config files for working with Git Bash in a Windows environment

# Installation #

First make sure you have [installed git from here](http://git-scm.com/download/). You also need to install [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.4.5.html).
Then just dowload the files in this repo and unpack them to your `%HOMEPATH%` dir (you can open this in explorer).


Afterwards, run the following in `Git Bash`:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"
```
